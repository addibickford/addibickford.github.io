    "section": "",
    "text": "The World Series ended over a week ago with the Texas Rangers convincingly beating the Arizona Diamondbacks four games to one. Was anyone expecting that these would be the last two teams playing in November? No, not really.\nRebuilding. That was the name of the game for these two teams and arguably the reason they were even in the World Series. Just two seasons ago, in 2021, the Rangers lost 102 games. Last season, was a little bit better with only losing 94. The Diamondbacks, on the other hand, lost a startling 110 games in the 2021 season and last season they improved by only losing 88 games. These were teams that people didn’t think would win the World Series anytime soon.\nLet’s take a look at how the season went for these two teams and the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"baseballregularseason.csv\")\n\nAL &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  group_by(Team, League) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    BaseHits = sum(H), \n    Strikeouts = sum(SO)) |&gt;\n  filter(League == \"AL\")\n\nNL &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  group_by(Team, League) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    BaseHits = sum(H), \n    Strikeouts = sum(SO)) |&gt;\n  filter(League == \"NL\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=AL, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, BaseHits), x=BaseHits, xend=Strikeouts),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n \n   labs(\n        x = \"Number of Base Hits & Strikeouts\",\n    y = \"American League\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=NL, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, BaseHits), x=BaseHits, xend=Strikeouts),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n      caption = \"Source: MLB.com | By Addi Bickford\",\n       x = \"Number of Base Hits & Strikeouts\",\n       y = \"National League\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face= \"bold\", size = 12),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\nbar1 + bar2  +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"Base Hits vs Strikeouts\", \n    subtitle = \"You always want more base hits than strikeouts. Ideally, you want &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Base Hits&lt;/span&gt; on the right and &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Strikeouts&lt;/span&gt; on the left. If that isn't the case for your team. How was your season this year?\"\n  ) & theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 9),\n    plot.title = element_text(face= \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rangers were number one in the American League at the end of the regular season having more base hits than strikeouts. In contrast, the Diamondbacks finished 10th in the National League but, fortunately, they did finish with more base hits than strikeouts as well.\nHow about home runs? How did that turn out for all the teams? You have the Braves pair of Acuna and Olson, the Dodgers duo of Freeman and Betts, and Angels All-Star Ohtani. No explanation is necessary.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nALtotals &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(League == \"AL\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    TotalHomeRuns = sum(HR),\n  )\n\nNLtotals &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(League == \"NL\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    TotalHomeRuns = sum(HR),\n  )\n\ntx &lt;- ALtotals |&gt; filter(Team == \"Texas Rangers\")\naz &lt;- NLtotals |&gt; filter(Team == \"Arizona Diamondbacks\")\nALbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ALtotals, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotalHomeRuns), weight=TotalHomeRuns), fill=\"darkgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=tx, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotalHomeRuns), weight=TotalHomeRuns), fill=\"#C0111F\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"American League\", \n    y=\"Home Runs\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nNLbar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=NLtotals, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotalHomeRuns), weight=TotalHomeRuns), fill=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=az, aes(x=reorder(Team, TotalHomeRuns), weight=TotalHomeRuns), fill=\"#30CED8\") + \n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x=\"National League\", \n    y=\"Home Runs\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nALbar + NLbar  + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Which Team Hit the Most Home Runs?\",\n    subtitle = \"Arizona is living proof that you don't have to just be a home-run hitting team to make it to the World Series.\",\n    caption = \"Source: MLB.com | By Addi Bickford\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you look at that? The Rangers are ranked first in the American League yet again. No surprise when you have players like Corey Seager and Adolis Garcia. However, the Diamondbacks finished 11th in the National League.\nOkay, so maybe the Diamondbacks aren’t power hitters. That’s fine. They probably lean more on extra-base hits like doubles & triples.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nextrabasehits &lt;- read_csv(\"extrabasehits.csv\")\n\nxbasehits&lt;- extrabasehits |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Doubles = sum(`2B`),\n    Triples = sum(`3B`),\n    Homeruns = sum(HR))\n\n xbh &lt;- xbasehits |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-Team, \n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Total\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=xbh, aes(x=reorder(Team, Total), weight=Total, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#002D72\", \"#D50032\", \"black\")) +\n  \n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Number of Extra Base Hits\", \n    title=\"Extra Base Hits By Teams This Season\",\n    subtitle=\"Home runs are always great, but doubles and triples can greatly impact a game.\", \n    caption=\"Source: MLB.com | By Addi Bickford\"\n    ) + \n  \n  theme_minimal() &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPer usual, the Rangers finished near the top while the Diamondbacks finished in the bottom half of the entire league yet again.\nSo how did the Arizona Diamondbacks make it to the World Series when their regular season was average?\nThe only answer that makes sense is they got hot at the right time and won when they needed to. Even though the Rangers won it all, it’s still a significant accomplishment for the Diamondbacks to make it when no one else thought they would."

Why is that?\nVolleyball Day in Nebraska.\nAugust 30th, 2023 will be a day that goes down in history for women’s sports. 92,003 people packed into Memorial Stadium to watch a volleyball match. Setting a world record for attendance at any women’s sporting event. Regardless of how that match went, it was a win for the state of Nebraska and volleyball fans around the world.\nWith Volleyball Day happening at the beginning of the season, you see many different schools break their home attendance record. The excitement for the sport of volleyball is at a whole new level. Many of these attendance records come from rivalry games like Pitt vs Louisville or Georgia vs Georgia Tech. Some even happen because fans want to watch the top teams in the nation like powerhouses Nebraska and Wisconsin.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nattendance&lt;-read_csv(\"attendancerecords.csv\")\n\nne &lt;- attendance |&gt; \n  filter(Opponent == \"Nebraska\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Attendance = sum(Attendance),\n  )\nwisco &lt;- attendance |&gt; \n  filter(Opponent == \"Wisconsin\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Attendance = sum(Attendance),\n  )\nggplot() + \n geom_bar(data=attendance, aes(x=reorder(Team, Attendance), weight=Attendance), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=ne, aes(x=reorder(Team, Attendance), weight=Attendance), fill=\"#d00000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=wisco, aes(x=reorder(Team, Attendance), weight=Attendance), fill=\"black\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Attendance Records of the 2023 Season\",\n    subtitle = \"Wisconsin and Nebraska aren't just battling on the court but also how many attendance records they can be apart of.\\n Red represents the games Nebraska was apart of an attendance record while black represents Wisconsin.\\n Note* Nebraska's attendance is from both Devaney and Memorial Stadium. \",\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Attendance\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA.com | By Addi Bickford\"\n    ) + \n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look into the Big Ten Conference.
